## Proposal

My research is focused on transfer market of football.

I've been a super fan of football for more than 10 years. Recent transfer market of football has been dramatically crazy. I was totally astonished at the monster contract that PSG gave to Kylian Mbappe.

Datasets of top transfers and transfer data of megaclubs such as Real Madrid, Manchester City will be favored and further analyzed.

Graphics and dynamic charts will be presented.

Transfer fee will keep rocketting in one year or two. But Russia-Ukraine conflict may have a great impact on this.
